# virtual-mouse
Something I made out for fun.... : )
I made a mouse that works with my fingers. 🖱️✌️
actually I’m kinda lazy... I needed this.
 but guess what? it’s also hard to use 😂
built a hand gesture-controlled virtual mouse using: Python + OpenCV + MediaPipe + PyAutoGUI
🔹 move your finger (INDEX) → move the cursor
 🔹 pinch (THUMB + INDEX) → click
 🔹 two fingers (INDEX + MIDDLE) → scroll
yeah that’s it. kinda cool tho? ...I guess it is 👀
 not perfect yet — still figuring out how to make it smoother and maybe add more features...
but hey, it moves around....
